A secure way to take attendance of students and teachers in a touchless and paperless manner in order to have a sustainable way. This project aims to provide a touchless and paperless attendance system.
This project uses a Deep Learning based model to mark attendance of people entering a establishment along with interfacing it with a serial based hardware.
